Linux Cgroups provide a framework to apply resource limits to linux system.

# Managing Process Priority

Cgroups can limit CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth for groups of processes. 

if processes are equal from  a perspective of Cgroups, the linux nice and renice commands can be used to adjust the priority of processes.


In Cgroups the Linux system is divided into 3 slices:
- system.slice : for system services
- user.slice : for user sessions
- machine.slice : for virtual machines and containers
 Each sline has an equal share of system resources.

 that means that if one or more processes whithin a slice requests more resources, they will be limited to the share of the slice.

 so 20 systemd processes together gets as much as one user process that claims full CPU usage.

 if systemd, the CPUWeight can be set on individual system units.

If no specific Cgroup are defined, Linux nice and renice can be used to define CPU priority.

To change priorities of non-realtime processes, the nice and renice commands are used.

nice values range from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority). The default nice value is 0.

Negative nice values indicate higher priority, while positive values indicate lower priority.

Users can set the nice value of their own processes to a positive value (lower priority), but only the root user can set negative nice values (higher priority).

To start a process with a specific nice value, use the nice command followed by the desired nice value and the command to run. For example, to start a process with a nice value of 10:

```bash
nice -n 10 command

nice -n -5 command  # requires root privileges
```
To change the nice value of an already running process, use the renice command followed by the new nice value and the PID of the process. For example, to change the nice value of a process with PID 1234 to 5:

```bash
renice -n 5 -p 1234
