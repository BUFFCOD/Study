Linux cgroups can limit CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth for groups of processes. For RHCSA, you mostly need basic CPU priority with nice/renice; cgroup slice weights are outside scope (systemd slices exist, but defaults are fine).

# Managing Process Priority

If cgroups are not explicitly set, Linux uses nice values to bias CPU scheduling.

- Range: -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority); default is 0.
- Regular users may only increase the nice value (lower their priority).
- Root can lower the nice value (raise priority) with negative numbers.

Start a process with a specific nice value:

```bash
nice -n 10 command
nice -n -5 command  # requires root
```

Change the nice value of a running process:

```bash
renice -n 5 -p 1234
