From the UEFI, the disk is assigned.

On the boot disk the first 1MiB is reserved for the metadata..

Historically, the first sector (MBR)  512 bytes sector was used for booting

Nowawdays the firmware address the UEFI boot partition, and the MBR only contains the protective MBR.

the protective MBR is for legacy applications and indicates that the disk is in use

the second sector the partition tbale is stored.

Each partition entry needs 128 bytes and with a total of 128 partition the can be created 32 sectors of 16KiB are used for the partition table.


Each Rhel system must have  partitons as the UEFI boot partition, is required in the boot procedure.



## Listing block devices

Depending on the driver that is used, different block devices may occur.

Use lsblk to get an overview of currently existing devices.

/dev/nvmexny are used for NVM Express devices

dev/sdX are used for SCSI devices, including SATA and SAS drives

/dev/vdx are used for Virtio block devices, commonly found in virtualized environments

On sd and vd devices, partitions are indicated by numbers following the device name, such as /dev/sda1 or /dev/sdb2.

sda2 is the second partition on the first SCSI or SATA drive.
sdb1 is the first partition on the second SCSI or SATA drive.

On nvme devices, partitions are indicated by a 'p' followed by the partition number, such as /dev/nvme0n1p1.

nvme0n1p1 is the first partition on the first NVM Express drive.
nvme1n1p2 is the second partition on the second NVM Express drive.

```bash
lsblk
``` 
lsblk read the kernal partition table in /proc/partitions

## Understanding GPT and MBR partitioning schemes

MBR is part of 1981 pc specification.

MBR was made they needed something to boot the computer from.

512 bytes for boot code info
of which 64 bytes are for the boot code
place for 4 partition  only with a max size of 2TiB

to use more partitions you need to use extended partitions and logical partitions must be used


the GUID Partition Table (GPT)  was introduced in 2010 to overcome MBR limitations.

more space to store partitioning 32 sectors instead of 64 bytes
supports up to 128 partitions by default
supports disks larger than 2TiB 8ZiB max appox 9 billion TiB
