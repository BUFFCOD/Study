A signal allows the Operating System to interrupt a from software and ask it to do something.

Interrupts are similar to signals, but are generated by hardware (like a timer or I/O device) rather than software.

A limited  numbber of signals can be used and is documented in man 7 signal.

Not all signals work in all cases.

the kill command is used to send signals to PIDs.

you can use k from top.

different kill-like commands exist, like pkill and killall.

Some common signals:
| Signal Name | Number | Description                          | Default Action        |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| SIGINT      | 2      | Interrupt from keyboard (Ctrl+C)     | Term
| SIGTERM     | 15     | Termination signal                   | Term                   |
| SIGKILL     | 9      | Kill signal (cannot be caught/ignored)|
| SIGSTOP     | 19     | Stop process (cannot be caught/ignored)| Stop                  |
| SIGCONT     | 18     | Continue if stopped                  | Continue               |
Processes can handle some signals (like SIGINT) by defining custom handlers, while others (like SIGKILL and SIGSTOP) cannot be caught or ignored.
Signals can be sent using the kill command followed by the signal name/number and the PID. For example, to send SIGTERM to a process with PID 1234:
```bash
kill -15 1234
```
or
```bash
kill -SIGTERM 1234

```
To stop a process, you can use:
```bash
kill -19 1234
```
To continue a stopped process:
```bash
kill -18 1234
``` 
killall sends SIGTERM by default:
```bash
killall process_name
killall -9 process_name  # sends SIGKILL
```
