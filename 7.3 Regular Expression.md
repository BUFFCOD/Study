## Understanding Regex


Reagular expressions are text patterns that are used by tools like grep and others.


dont confuse regular expressions with globbing(shellwitldcards)!

EX.
grep 'a*' a*

used for specific tools only (grep,vim,awk,sed)

they are confusing because they are different sets of regular expression
if it is extend regualr expression dont always work use grep -E it is a extended regular expression also some languages like perl have their own regular expressions
