Understanding System Profiles


Kernals tunables  are provided through the /proc/sys/ directory in the /proc pseudo-filesystem.

different files in the /proc/sys/  directory contain the current settings as its value.


Change the current value by echoing a new value into the file:
```bash
 echo 50 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
 cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
```
To make the changes persistent across reboots, add them to the /etc/sysctl.d:
```bash
cat >> swappiness.conf << EOF
vm.swappiness=50
EOF
```
Then apply the changes with:
```bash
sysctl --system
```

to make system tuning easier, tuned is provided

tuned is a  systemd service that works with different profiles
tuned-adm list  # list available profiles
tuned-adm profile virtual-guest  # set profile to virtual-guest as default

each profiled contains a file with the name tuned.conf that has a wide range of performance related settings.

the reapply_sysctl = 1 parameter in /etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf ensures that, in case of conflicts, the sysctl parameters wins


Custom tuned profiles are stored in /etc/tuned/.

each profile should have a file tuned.conf, containing the requested performance settings.

After creating the directory with the corresponding tuned.conf, it will automatically be detected by tuned-adm.
