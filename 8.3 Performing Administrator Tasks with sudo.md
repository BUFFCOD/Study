sudo ls /root > ~/output.txt

This runs `ls` as root, but the redirection happens as your user. To run the whole pipeline as root, wrap it:

```bash
sudo sh -c "ls /root > ~/output.txt"
# or
sudo ls /root | sudo tee ~/output.txt > /dev/null
```

# Using `sudo`

- **`sudo`** is a more secure mechanism to perform administration tasks.
- Behind **`sudo`** is the `/etc/sudoers` configuration file.
- While editing `/etc/sudoers` through **`visudo`**, very detailed administration privileges can be assigned.
- To run an administration task using **`sudo`**, use the `sudo` command.
- This will prompt for the current user password and run the command if it is allowed through `/etc/sudoers`.
- To open a root shell, `sudo -i` can be used.
