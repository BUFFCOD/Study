sometime when you changeing a file with sed and the thing you are changing have the same sybmol as you delimiter you will need to change it

sed 's./etc..' paths.txt

sed 's//etc..' paths.txt

the second command has the same delimiter as the path im trying to remove so therefore i need to change it to something else so i chose a dot now it will work.

sed -n 5p /etc/passwd
