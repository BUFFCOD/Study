awk is a powerful text and data extraction and reporting

awk -F : '/linda/ { print $NF }' /etc/passwd 

This prints the last field (the shell) for user linda from /etc/passwd.

## 7.5 Using sed

sed is the stream edito, used to search and transform  text


sed -i 's/Pineapple/Feta/' toppings.txt 

allows you to change pineapple to feta inplace using the -i option


sometimes when the pattern contains `/`, pick another delimiter:

sed 's|/etc/|/srv/|' paths.txt

to show the 5th line of a file 

sed -n 5p /etc/passwd
