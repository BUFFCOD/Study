systemd provides unit.timer files that go together with unit.service files to schedule the services files.


When using systemd timers tthe timer should be enabled and started not the service unit.

systemd timers are oftion installed from rpm packages

in the timer unit files the OnCalendar option specifies when the service should be started.


Since RHEL 9 systemd timers are the default way for scheduling tasks instead of cron jobs.


systemctl list-unit -t timer
systemctl list-unit-files lograte.*
systemctl status lograte.timer
systemctl status lograte.service
dnf install sysstats -y
systemctl list-unit-files sysstat.*
systemctl cat sysstat-collect.timer

## Understanding Timer Activation

The systemd timer OnCalendar option uses a rich language to express when the timer should activate the service.
For example:
OnCalendar=*-*-* 00:00:00
means every day at midnight.
OnCalendar=Mon *-*-* 12:00:00
means every Monday at noon.
OnCalendar=*-*-01 00:00:00
means the first day of every month at midnight.
OnCalendar=*-12-25 00:00:00
means every Christmas day at midnight.
Other options include:
OnActiveSec=
OnBootSec=
to start the service a certain time after boot or after the timer is activated.
OnStartupSec=
OnUnitActiveSec=
Means to start the service a certain time after the timer is activated.
OnUnitInactiveSec=  



## Scheduling Tasks with Cron
Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. Users can schedule jobs (commands or scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.

It uses crond a daemon that checks is configurations to run cron jobs periodically.

most services that scheduling are scheduled through systemd timers.


the crond process checks its configuration every minute

/etc/crontab is the man (managed) file for system-wide cron jobs.
/etc/cron.d/ is the directory for additional system-wide cron jobs in other words a dropin files.

/etc/cron.d can beused for dropin files.

/etc/cron.hourly/  -  scripts to be run every hour
/etc/cron.daily/   -  scripts to be run every day
/etc/cron.weekly/  -  scripts to be run every week
/etc/cron.monthly/ -  scripts to be run every month

cron time specification are specified in five fields:
* minute (0-59)
* hour (0-23)
* day of month (1-31)
* month (1-12)
* day of week (0-7) (Sunday is 0 or 7)
For example:
30 2 * * 1 /path/to/script.sh
means run the script at 2:30 AM every Monday.

the /etc/crontab file has nice syntax examples

DO NOT EDIT /etc/crontab directly instead create files in /etc/cron.d/ for system wide cron jobs.




anacron is the service behind cron that ensures that jobs are executed on a regular basis,but not at a specific time.

it takes care of the jobs in /etc/cron.hourly/, /etc/cron.daily/, /etc/cron.weekly/, and /etc/cron.monthly/ directories.

Configurations for anacron are in /etc/anacrontab

DO NOT EDIT /etc/anacrontab directly instead create files in /etc/cron.d/ for system wide cron jobs or systemd timers.
