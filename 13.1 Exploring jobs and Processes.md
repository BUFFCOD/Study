# Exploring Jobs and Processes

- Every task runs as a process with a unique PID; some processes spawn multiple threads for concurrency.
- Core management tasks: start/stop, foreground/background control, priorities, and sending signals.

## Job Control Basics (shell)

| Action                                | How to do it                          | Notes                              |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Start in background                   | `command &`                           | Shell assigns a job number (`[1]`).|
| Pause current foreground job          | `Ctrl+Z`                              | Sends `SIGTSTP`; job becomes stopped.|
| Resume a stopped job in background    | `bg %job`                             | `%1` resumes job 1; `%` optional.  |
| Bring a job to the foreground         | `fg %job`                             | `fg` with no arg brings last job.  |
| List current shell jobs               | `jobs`                                | Shows job numbers and states.      |

Example:

```bash
$ sleep 300 &
[1] 12345
$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 sleep 300 &
```

## Viewing Processes

- `ps aux` (BSD style) shows all processes with user, CPU/mem usage, state, and command.
- `ps -ef` (SysV style) is another common all-process view.
- Job numbers are shell-local; PIDs in `ps` are global to the system. Use `%job` with `bg/fg`, but use PIDs with tools like `kill`.
