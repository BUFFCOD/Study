## Brace Expansion


- Brace expansion generates arbitrary strings... creating multiple files or directories with a comman naming pattern.

- Example:
    1. touch {file1,file2,file3}.txt |||| this will create 3 files 

    2. mkdir /backups/{2025-01,2025-02}: Creates two directories: /backups/2025-01 and /backups/2025-02

## Globbing 

- Globbing uses special characters to match patterns of filenames. some examples

    1. *: Matches any sequence of characters, including none.

    2. ?: Matches any single character.

    3. []: Matches any single character within the specified set. A range can be specified using a hyphen (e.g., [a-z]).

    4. [^]: Matches any single character NOT in the specified set.

- Examples:
    1. ls *.txt: Lists all files in the current directory ending with .txt.

    2. rm file?.log: Removes files named fileA.log, fileB.log, etc.

    3. ls [abc]*.log: Lists files starting with 'a', 'b', or 'c' and ending with .log.

## Command Substitution $()


- This allows the output of one command to be used as an argument for another. The shell runs the command inside $(...) and replaces the expression with the output.

- Example:

    1. echo "Today is $(date)" prints "Today is " followed by the current date.

    2. tar -czf backup-$(date +%F).tar.gz /data creates a compressed archive with a filename that includes the current date (e.g., backup-2025-09-22.tar.gz).


## Alias

- alias can be used to define custom commands.

- Example:
    1. alias key = value tp define your own alias, 
        1.1 alias del='rm'
    2. Use unalias to remove an alias
    3. Custom aliases are stored in the Bash startup files

## Filesystem Hieracrhy

- /usr

    1. hold subdirectories the can be executable like bin is executable for every one and sbin require sudo


- /var
    1. hold direcertories that are dynamically created like logs

- /etc 
    1. hold directories that are for configerations

- /dev 
    1. hold device like your harddrive and usb ports
