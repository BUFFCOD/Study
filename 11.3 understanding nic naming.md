Bios devices Names

Classical nameing is using device names like eth0, eth1 and so on.
     these devices names dont reveal any information about physcial 
     device location 

    BIOS nameing is based on  hardware properties to give more specific information in the device name.

        eno[nn] is the alternative nothation for embedded nics
