BIOS device names

Classical naming uses device names like eth0, eth1 and so on.
     these device names dont reveal any information about physical 
     device location 

    BIOS naming is based on hardware properties to give more specific information in the device name.
        en{1...} embedded nics
        eno[nn] is the alternative nothation for embedded nics
        
        P<slot>p<port> for NICs on the PCU bus

        if the driver doesn't reveal network device properties, classical
        naming is used.


to set hostname use the command
```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname>
```

the hostname is stored in /etc/hostname file.
to resolve hostname use /etc/hosts file.
 example: 
```bash
127.0.0.1   localhost
```
```
192.168.1.10 myserver.mydomain.com myserver
```
/etc/resolv.conf is used to configure DNS servers for hostname resolution.
the order of resolution is configured in /etc/nsswitch.conf file.
