## Accessing Repositories

To acess repositories, a RHEL system should be register usign subscription-manager.

subscription-manager tries to acess  the online red hat repositorie to download and install packages and updates.

As an alternative to online repositories, repositories can be offered through red hat satellite server.

If no internet access is available,  nor Red Hat Satellite server, no repositories will be available to the system by default.

to access repositories that are offered through subscription-manager, use the command:

```bash
dnf config-manager --enable <repository_name>
```

third party repositories can be added by creating repo files in /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory or by using the command:

```bash
dnf config-manager --add-repo <repository_url>
dnf config-manager --add-repo file:///<path_to_repo_file>
dnf config-manager --add-repo file:///repos/AppStream
dnf config-manager --add-repo file:///repos/BaseOS
ls /etc/yum.repos.d/
```

add gpgcheck=0 to the end of the configuraion file created in /etc/yum.repos.d/ to disable gpg signature check if the repository does not provide gpg signatures.
