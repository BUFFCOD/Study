# Exploring Common Text Tools in Linux  

## head and tail
- **head** → shows the **first 10 lines** of a file.  
- **tail** → shows the **last 10 lines** of a file.  
- `-n #` → specify how many lines.  

**Example:**  
```bash
head -n 10 /etc/passwd | tail -n 1
```
Shows the **10th line** of `/etc/passwd`.  

---

## cat
- Prints file contents to screen.  
- Useful options:  
  - `-A` → shows non-printable characters (good for strict syntax files).  
  - `-b` → numbers lines (excluding blank ones).  
  - `-s` → suppress repeated empty lines.  

---

## less
- Lets you view text one screen at a time.  
- Searching inside `less`:  
  - `/<word>` → search for a word and highlight matches.  
  - Use `n` to jump to the next match.  

---

## tail -f
- `tail -f /var/log/messages` → live updates of a file as it grows (great for logs).  

---

## cut
- Extracts specific parts of text.  

**Example:**  
```bash
cut -d : -f 1 /etc/passwd
```
- `-d` → delimiter (`:` here).  
- `-f` → field number (shows usernames).  

---

## grep
- Finds matching text in a file or output.  
- Useful flags:  
  - `-B#` → show lines **before** a match.  
  - `-A#` → show lines **after** a match.  
  - `-C#` → show lines **before & after** a match (context).  

**Examples with running processes (`ps faux`):**  
```bash
ps faux | grep -B5 bash   # 5 lines before "bash"
ps faux | grep -A5 bash   # 5 lines after "bash"
ps faux | grep -C5 bash   # 5 lines before & after "bash"
```

✅ With just these tools (`head`, `tail`, `cat`, `less`, `cut`, `grep`) you can inspect, filter, and search almost any log or text file in Linux.
