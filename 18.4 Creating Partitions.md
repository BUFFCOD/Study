fdisk is the recommended utility abd gas been around since the earlisted linux versions.

Offer easy access to advanced partitioning features.

COmpletely reworked to support MBR and GPT partitioning schemes.

on new disk create a GPT partition table using option g ; it creates an MBR partition table by default.


gdisk was introduced to provide GPT support only but is no loger is installed by default.

parted is a more advanced partitioning tool that supports both MBR and GPT partitioning schemes.



A partition type is a low level identifier of the operating system filesystem, and boot manager using a specific partition.

Partition types were important in the past currently most partitions will work if the wrong partition type is set.

in fdisk use the t command to change the partition type.

use Aliases to set the apporpriate partition type.

linux: standard linux filesystem
linux swap: linux swap partition
lvm: linux lvm partition
uefi: efi system partition

other partitons type are using l option for listing all partition types.

```bash 
fdisk /dev/sdb
```


## creating and Mounting Filesystems

XFS is the default filesystem in RHEL.

fast and scalable journaling filesystem.

Uses CoW (Copy on Write) to ensure data integrity.

sizee can be increased not decreased.

ext4 is the default in RHEL 6 and is still available.

backward compatible with ext3 and ext2.

uses journal to guarantee data integrity

size can be increased and decreased.

vfat offes multiplatform compatibility.
commonly used for UEFI system partitions.

btrfs is a modern filesystem with advanced features like snapshots and checksums.
suitable for specific use cases like container storage.

to create a filesystem use the mkfs command followed by the filesystem type.

```bash 
mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1 creates an XFS filesystem on /dev/sdb1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2 creates an ext4 filesystem on /dev/sdb2
mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb3 creates a vfat filesystem on /dev/sdb3
```

after creating a filesystem mount it using the mount command.

```bash
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
```
use unmount to unmount the filesystem.

```bash
umount /mnt
```
use lsof /mnt if you get an error about the device being busy to see which processes are using the mount point.

the mount command shows all mounted filesystems includeing administrative kernels mounts.

findmnt command show which filesystem is mounted where in the direcorty structure.

lsblk is probably the most convenient way to get an overview of which partitions are mounted where.

```bash
