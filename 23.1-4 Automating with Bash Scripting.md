# 23.1 Basg Scripting Basic Components

A shell script is an executable file used to run tasks

SHell scripts are used to automate common tasks

A Shell script can be as simple as a number of command that is sequentially executed

Scripts normaaly work with variables to make them react differently in different environments.

Conditional statement such as for it case and while can be used to execute task only in specific conditions


Shell scripts are command as they are easy to learn and implement.

Also a shell will always be available to interpret code from shell scripts.

If the script uses interal commands only, its's fast as nothing needs to be loaded.

There is no need to compile anything


for more complex work advanced scripting like python or automation solutions like ansible are commonly used

To run scripts indepently store them as executable files

It is good practice but not mandatory to use the .sh extension


Each script should start with #!/bin/bash the so called shebang

    this identifies the shell that should be used to run the script code 

Use # for comments
Use whites lines for readability

Variables areused to work with dynamic or site specific values
Variables can be provided in many ways
By defining key=value inside the script

By providing an argument while running the script the value of the argument is stored in the positional parameter $1 

To define a variable no $ is needed to refer to put $ in front 

color=red
echo color
echo $color



## 23.2 Using Variables and Positional Parameters


Variables are used to make shell scripts dynamic

Site-specific information is stored in a varible, which can be picked up dynamically while running the script


If an argument is passed to the script while it is started this argument known as positional parameter is further treated as a variable

## 23.3 Execuing Conditional Code with if and test 


The test command can be used to test many things 
    Properties of files
    Contents of Strings
    Values of Integers
    and etc..

test is commonly used if.. thenn... else statements
the common use is test conditions

Which can also be write in as [ commmand ]

If statements are used to run commnad only if a specific condition is true 

To identify the command s to be run then is used.

else can optionally be used to run other commands if the condition is not true.

fi must be used to close an if statement.


## 23.4 Using for and while


While is used to run command as long aas a specific condition is true 

for is used to iterate over a series of elements
    Use to process all valuse of a variable 
    or to work on all files in a directory that match a specific pattern
    



# Lesson 23 Lab: Writing Shell Scripts

## Lab Requirements

- Write a script that makes a copy of each file that has the `*.txt` extension.
  - The copy should be named `filename.txt.bak`.
  - After making the copy, the script should move it to the `/tmp` directory.

- While running the script, the directory where it should look for the files **must be provided as an argument**.

- If **no argument** is provided, the script should **stop with exit code `9`**.
