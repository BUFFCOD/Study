## 24.6 Synchronizing files securely

rsync is using SSH to synchronize files

if source and target files already exists, rsync will only synchronize their differences.

the rsync command can used with many options, which the following are most common

    -r will recrusively syncrhonize the entire directory tree
    -l syncronizes symbolic links
    -p preserves symbolic links
    -n will do a dry runn before actually synchronizing 
    -a uses archive mode which is equivalnet to -rlptgoD
    -A uses archive mode and also synchronizes ACLs
    -X will synchronize SELinux Context as well
