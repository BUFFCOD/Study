# 20.4 Managing Systemd Targets

A systemd target is a group of unit files

Some target are isolatable which means that they define the final state a system is starting in,

emergency.target
rescue.target
multi-user.target
graphical.target

When enableing a unit it is added to a specific target.

## Setting the Default Systemd Target


Use systemctl get-default  to see the current default target.


Use systemctl set-default  to set a new default target.


## Booting into a Specific Target

On the Grub2 boot prompt use systemd.unit=targetname.target to boot into a specific target for that session.

to change between tartgets on a running system use systemctl isolate targetname.target
