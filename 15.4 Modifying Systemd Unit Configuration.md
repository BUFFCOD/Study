Default system-provided unit files are stored in the /usr/lib/systemd/system/ directory.

yoy should not modify these files directly, as they may be overwritten during system updates.

Custom unit files and overrides should be placed in the /etc/systemd/system/ directory.

runtime automatically generated unit files are stored in the /run/systemd/system/ directory.

better to use systemctl edit <unit_name> to create override files for existing units.

```bash
systemctl edit sshd
```


## Masking Services

Some units cannot work simultaneously on the same system. 

To prevent administorators from accidentally starting these units, use systemctl mask <unit_name>.

systemctl mask  links a unit of the specified name to /dev/null, making it impossible to start the unit.

systemctl unmask <unit_name> removes the link to /dev/null, allowing the unit to be started again.

```bash
sudo systemctl mask sshd
sudo systemctl unmask sshd
```
