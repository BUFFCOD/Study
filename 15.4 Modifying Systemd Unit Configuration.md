Default system-provided unit files are stored in the /usr/lib/systemd/system/ directory.

yoy should not modify these files directly, as they may be overwritten during system updates.

Custom unit files and overrides should be placed in the /etc/systemd/system/ directory.

runtime automatically generated unit files are stored in the /run/systemd/system/ directory.

better to use systemctl edit <unit_name> to create override files for existing units.

```bash
systemctl edit sshd
```


## Masking Services

Some units cannot work simultaneously on the same system.
