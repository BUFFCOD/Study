# User Properties

User properties are managed in **/etc/passwd** and **/etc/shadow**.

- **Name**: the name of the account.
- **Password**: the secret that is used for authentication, may be disabled.
- **UID**: a unique identifier for users.
- **GID**: the ID of the primary group.
- **GECOS**: additional non-mandatory information about the user.
- **Home directory**: the environment where users create personal files.
- **Shell**: the program that will be started after successful authentication.



# Manage User Default Settings

- Write default settings to **/etc/login.defs**.
- Files in **/etc/skel** are copied to the user home directory upon creation.
- Apart from this, RHEL 10 uses **Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)**, which is used to define more advanced default settings  
  *(not an RHCSA topic)*.

## authselect
- **authselect** is used as a front-end to manage these settings.
- **authselect** works with profiles.
- **authselect current** shows the current profile (should be `local`).
- **authselect list-features local** shows features for the local profile.
- **authselect enable-feature …** allows you to enable specific features.

# Limiting User Access

- User accounts can be temporarily locked:
  - `usermod -L anna` will lock user **anna**
  - `usermod -U anna` will unlock user **anna**

- User accounts can also be set to expire:
  - `usermod -e 2032-01-01 bill`  
    Expires user account **bill** on **01-01-2032**

- Set **/sbin/nologin** as the shell for users that are not intended to log in at all:
  - `usermod -s /sbin/nologin myapp`
