# Understanding the Need for SELinux in RHEL

Linux security is built on UNIX security

UNIX security consists of different solutions that were never developed with current IT security needs in mind. 
MOst of these solutions focus on a part of the operating systems.
SELinux provides a complete and mandatory security solution.
THe principle is that if isnt specifically allowed it will be denied.

As a result unkown  serveices will always need additional configuration to enable them in an environment where SELinux is enabled.
Known services work well with the standard SELinux configuration.


## 27.3 Managing SELinux Modes


getenforce will show the current mode of SELinux

setenforce Enforcing|Permissive|Disabled
setenforce 0 → Permissive
setenforce 1 → Enforcing
setenforce Disabled → Disabled

Edit /etc/sysconfig/selinux to set the default state to Permissive or Enforcing

To switch to disabled, you'll need to pass boot parameter.

Never set to disabled if this meant as a temporary measure only.

## 27.4 SELinux Components Overview

SeLinux works with context labels.
Context labels define specific permissions.
Context labels are applied to source objects and target objects.
Source objects are 
    Users
    Processes
Target objects are
    Files
    Ports
    Network interfaces
    Other resources

The SELinux Policy has many rules to deine which source context has access to which target context.

Context management is about applying context to mostly files, directories and ports.
You'll need to apply a context that matches a specific rule.

Booleans allow parts of the SELinux policy to be rewritten to allow or disallow specific functionality in an easy way.
