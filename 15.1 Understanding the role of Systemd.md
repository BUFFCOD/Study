Systemd is  started as the first process after the kernel boots and is the manger of everything. It is used to start  and stop services like web servers, databases, and other applications.  Apart from services systemd can take care of other items like mounting file systems, managing network connections, and handling user logins.

the items that are started by systemd are called units


systemctl is the main management tool for systemd. It is used to start, stop, enable, disable, and check the status of services and other units.

to get an overview of all the type of units that are available, use  

```bash
systemctl -t help
```
for an overview of all the units that are currently loaded, use 

```bash
systemctl list-units
```


### Exploreing Systemd Units

Service units are sued to start processes
socket units monitor activity on a port and start the corresponding service when activity is detected.

timer units are used to schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals.

path units monitor file system paths and trigger actions when changes are detected.

mount unit are used to mount file systems.

service units  are often used to start daemon processes

other types of service units are available as well

```bash
type=simple can be used to start any command through systemd
```


### Managing Systemd Services

use systemctl status <service_name> to check the status of a service

```bash
systemctl status sshd
```
use systemctl start <service_name> to start a service

```bash 
systemctl start sshd
```
use systemctl stop <service_name> to stop a service
```bash
systemctl stop sshd
```
use systemctl enable <service_name> to enable a service to start at boot time you can also --now to start the service immediately and enable it at boot time
```bash
systemctl enable --now sshd
```
use systemctl disable <service_name> to disable a service from starting at boot time
```bash
systemctl disable sshd
```
use systemctl restart <service_name> to restart a service
