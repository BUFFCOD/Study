# 🧾 Linux Notes

## 🔍 Finding Files

### 1. `which`

* The `which` command **only locates executable files** in your `PATH`.
* Example:

  ```bash
  which hosts
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  /usr/bin/which: no hosts in (/home/sysadmin/.local/bin:/home/sysadmin/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin)
  ```

---

### 2. `locate`

* Uses a **database** to quickly find files by name.
* The database is updated by the `updatedb` command.
* Example:

  ```bash
  locate hosts
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  /usr/share/man/man8/pam_rhosts.8.gz
  ```
* ⚠️ Can be too broad — returns all matching file names, even if not useful.

---

### 3. `find`

* **Very flexible** — allows searching by name, extension, type, content, etc.

#### Find files by extension:

```bash
find /path/to/search -name '*.ext'
```

#### Find files containing specific text using `-exec`:

```bash
sudo find /etc -exec grep -l student {} \;
```

* Searches files under `/etc`
* For each file, `grep` is used to check if it contains the word `student`
* `-exec ... \;` runs the command for each result

#### Combine with `xargs` for better performance:

```bash
sudo find /etc/ -type f -name '*' | xargs grep "127.0.0.1"
```

* Finds all files under `/etc`
* Passes them to `grep` to search for `127.0.0.1`

---

### 4. `xargs`

* Takes input (e.g. from `find`) and applies a command to it
* Useful for applying commands to many files efficiently

## 📂 Mounting Filesystems

### View all mounted filesystems:

```bash
mount
```

---

### Mounting Devices

#### Basic mount:

```bash
mount /dev/sdX /mnt/your_dir
```

#### Mount with auto-directory creation:

```bash
mount --mkdir /dev/sdX /mnt/your_dir
```

#### Mount with user options (e.g., for a specific UID/GID):

```bash
mount -o uid=1000,gid=1000 /dev/sdX /mnt/your_dir
```

#### Mount ISO/CD-ROM (read-only):

```bash
mount -t iso9660 -o ro /dev/cdrom /cdrom
```

#### Mount all from `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
mount -a
```

#### Mount specific filesystem from `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
mount /my_drive
```

#### Bind mount (mount a directory to another location):

```bash
mount --bind /source/dir /target/dir
```

---

### Unmounting

To unmount a device:

```bash
umount /dev/sda1
```

---

## 📊 Device & Mount Information

### `findmnt`

* Shows all **currently mounted** devices and their mount points.

### `lsblk`

* Lists **block devices**, partitions, and where they're mounted.

Example:

```bash
lsblk
```

Output:

```
