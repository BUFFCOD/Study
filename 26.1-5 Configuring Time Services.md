## Exploring Linux Time 

While booting the system get its time from the hardware clock.

System time is set next, according to the hardware clock.

Internettime can be used to synchronize time.

If the difference between local time and internet time is more than 1,000 seconds, the NTP client will refuse to synchronize.


hwclock is used to set hardware time 

also use it to synchronize time,

hwclock --systohc
hwclock --hctosys

date is used to show and set time

timedatectl is used to manage time and timezone configuration.

## 26.2 Setting time with timedatectl

timedatectl allows you to manage all aspects of system time

    timedatectl status will show all time properties currently used
    timedatectl set-time is used to change the time
    timedatectl set-timezone is used to change the timezone.
    timedatectl set-ntp enables or disables NTP time sync

    To synchronize time using NTP, an NTP service must be configured.

        RHEL 10 use chrony
        systemd-timesyncd.service is another NTP service - not currently used on RHEL.

## 26.3 Using date

DOn't use date to set itme, better use timedatectl.
date is useful because of the many options it offers to print time in a specific format

date +%d-%m-%y
date +"%A %d %B %Y"

## 26.4 Managing an NTP Client

chronyd is the default RHEL 10 NTP service.
use /etc/chrony.conf to specify syncronization parameters.

pool 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst configures a pool of NTP servers
server myservere.example.com configures a single NTP time source

Use iburst to permit fast synchronization

After modifying its contents, use systemctl restart chronyd to restart the chronyd service.

Use chronyc sources to verify proper synchronization

## 26.5 Managing an NTP Server


Internet time services have a reliablity that is express as the stratum.

Stratum 1 servers have the highest level of reliablity.

IF a time synchronization process synchronizes with a stratum 1 server, it offers stratum 2 services itself.

If the firewall allows access to NTp port 123, it makes an NTP client that successfully synchronized an NTP server as well.

Stratum 10 is commonly used as the backup configuration; the stratum is low enought which makes it unlikely that an NTP client ever synchronizes with it.

Stratum 16 is used to advertise unavailiablity of an NTP service.
