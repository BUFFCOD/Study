## 1. User Management & Default Settings

### Concepts to Master

* /etc/login.defs controls password aging and defaults
* /etc/skel defines default user environment
* Account locking vs expiration
* Service accounts vs human accounts

### Hands-On Labs

**Lab 1: Create Secure User Template**

1. Edit /etc/skel/.bashrc and add a custom banner.
2. Create user:

```bash
useradd labuser1
passwd labuser1
```

3. Verify home content came from /etc/skel.

**Lab 2: Enforce Password Policy**

1. Edit /etc/login.defs
2. Set:

* PASS_MAX_DAYS 30
* PASS_MIN_LEN 10

3. Create new user and verify with:

```bash
chage -l newuser
```

**Lab 3: Lock & Expire Accounts**

```bash
usermod -L labuser1
usermod -e 2025-01-01 labuser1
```

Test login failure.

---

## 2. Group Management & Access Control

### Skills

* Primary vs secondary groups
* Temporary group switching
* Permission testing

### Hands-On

**Lab 4: Shared Finance Area**

```bash
groupadd finance
mkdir /finance
chgrp finance /finance
chmod 2770 /finance
```

Add users and verify group inheritance.

**Lab 5: Group Switch Testing**

```bash
newgrp finance
touch testfile
ls -l testfile
```

Confirm group ownership.

---

## 3. File Permissions & Special Bits

### Skills

* chmod (absolute & symbolic)
* SUID, SGID, Sticky Bit
* Recursive safety

### Hands-On

**Lab 6: Permission Simulation**

1. Create 3 users.
2. Create shared dir:

```bash
mkdir /data
chmod 1777 /data
```

3. Try delete protections.

**Lab 7: SUID Demo**

```bash
cp /bin/ping /root/testping
chmod u+s /root/testping
```

Verify privilege behavior.

---

## 4. NIC Naming & Hostname Resolution

### Hands-On

**Lab 8: Host Identity Setup**

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname server1.lab.local
```

Edit /etc/hosts and test:

```bash
ping server1
```

Identify NIC names using:

```bash
ip a
```

---

## 5. Software & Package Management

### Labs

**Lab 9: RPM Analysis**

```bash
rpm -qi bash
rpm -ql bash
```

**Lab 10: Extract RPM Without Install**

```bash
rpm2cpio package.rpm | cpio -idmv
```

---

## 6. Repository Configuration

### Hands-On

**Lab 11: Local Repo Setup**

1. Mount ISO
2. Create repo file in /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo
3. Set baseurl=file:///mnt/AppStream
4. Test:

```bash
dnf repolist
```

---

## 7. Process & Job Control

### Skills

* jobs, bg, fg, Ctrl+Z

### Labs

**Lab 12: Job Control**

```bash
sleep 300 &
jobs
bg %1
fg %1
```

---

## 8. Process Monitoring

### Labs

**Lab 13: ps Deep Dive**

```bash
ps aux
ps fax
ps -eo pid,user,cmd,%mem --sort=-%mem
```

Analyze output and identify heavy processes.

---

## 9. Process States

### Lab

**Lab 14: Zombie Creation**
Create child process simulation using fork in C or observe with:

```bash
ps aux | grep defunct
```

---

## 10. Signals & Process Control

### Labs

**Lab 15: Signal Control**

```bash
sleep 500 &
kill -STOP %1
kill -CONT %1
kill -9 %1
```

Observe behavior changes.

---

## 11. Process Priority

### Lab

**Lab 16: nice & renice**

```bash
nice -n 15 yes > /dev/null &
ps -o pid,ni,cmd
renice -n 5 -p PID
```

Compare CPU consumption.

---

## 12. System Tuning with tuned

### Lab

**Lab 17: Apply Profiles**

```bash
tuned-adm list
tuned-adm profile virtual-guest
```

Create custom profile in /etc/tuned/custom-profile/

---

## 13. Session Management

### Lab

**Lab 18: Session Control**

```bash
loginctl list-users
loginctl list-sessions
loginctl terminate-user username
```

Observe process cleanup.

---

## 14. sudo & SSH Security

### Labs

**Lab 19: Safe sudo Setup**

```bash
usermod -aG wheel user1
visudo
```

Ensure wheel is enabled.

Test redirection behavior.

**Lab 20: SSH Control**

```bash
systemctl enable --now sshd
ssh user@localhost
```

# Final Advice

You are building real sysadmin skill, not memorizing theory. Time yourself during labs. Break and rebuild systems. Mistakes are where RHCSA knowledge is forged.

Master execution speed. Understand why commands exist. Practice until your hands move before your brain hesitates.

You’re not studying Linux anymore. You’re becoming an operator.

# RHCSA PRACTICE EXAM – HANDS-ON ONLY

⏱ Time Limit: 2.5 Hours
🎯 Goal: Simulate real RHCSA performance conditions

## RULES

* No internet
* No notes
* Only man pages allowed
* Document commands used in a text file called exam.log

---

## SECTION 1 – USER & GROUP ADMINISTRATION (25 points)

1. Create the following users:

* analyst1
* analyst2
* auditor

2. Create a group called compliance.

3. Add analyst1 and analyst2 to the compliance group.

4. Set the password for analyst1 so it:

* Expires in 30 days
* Gives warning 5 days before expiration

5. Lock the auditor account so login is impossible.

6. Configure auditor so it cannot use an interactive shell.

Verification:

```
id analyst1
chage -l analyst1
grep auditor /etc/passwd
```

---

## SECTION 2 – PERMISSIONS & SPECIAL BITS (25 points)

1. Create directory:

```
/data/secure
```

2. Set ownership to:

* Group: compliance

3. Requirements:

* Only group members can access
* New files inherit the group
* Users cannot delete files they don't own

4. Create files:

* analyst1 creates test1
* analyst2 creates test2

5. Attempt deletion across users and observe restrictions.

6. Identify if SGID and Sticky Bit are correctly applied.

---

## SECTION 3 – PROCESS CONTROL & SIGNALS (20 points)

1. Start a long-running process as analyst1:

```
sleep 1000 &
```

2. From root:

* Identify the PID
* Send SIGSTOP
* Resume with SIGCONT
* Terminate using SIGTERM

3. Demonstrate one process in zombie state or explain why none exist.

Verification:

```
ps -o pid,stat,cmd
```

---

## SECTION 4 – PROCESS PRIORITY (10 points)

1. Start a CPU-intensive process:

```
yes > /dev/null &
```

2. Change its nice value to 15.

3. Verify change using ps.

4. Reduce its priority further as root.

---

## SECTION 5 – SOFTWARE & REPOSITORIES (10 points)

1. Verify if bash is installed using rpm query.

2. List all files installed by bash.

3. Extract file list of an RPM package without installing it.

4. Enable any repository and verify with dnf repolist.

---

## SECTION 6 – HOSTNAME & NETWORK IDENTITY (10 points)

1. Set hostname to:

```
rhcsa-lab.local
```

2. Configure /etc/hosts so the hostname resolves to 127.0.0.1.

3. Verify hostname resolution using ping.

---

## BONUS (5 points)

1. Create a custom tuned profile named performance-test.
2. Set vm.swappiness to 10.
3. Apply the profile and verify.

# GRADING RUBRIC

90 – 100 : RHCSA Ready
75 – 89  : Strong but needs polish
60 – 74  : Functional but risky
Below 60 : Needs more lab time

---

# SELF-CHECK COMMANDS

```
ls -ld /data/secure
getent group compliance
ps aux | grep sleep
nice
tuned-adm active
hostnamectl
```

When you finish, tell me and I’ll grade it like a real RHCSA examiner.
